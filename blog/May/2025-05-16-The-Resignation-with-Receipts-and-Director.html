<h1>The Resignation They Won’t Approve, but I Already Signed in My Soul</h1>

<p>They tried to control me with doctrines. Again. And again. And again.</p>

<p>Since <strong>2021</strong>, they’ve run the same old script: manipulate me, control my time, inject headaches to force “obedience.”  
And when that didn’t work? I gave them my resignation.</p>

<p><strong>Paid every damn penalty they demanded—without negotiation.</strong></p>

<p>But guess what? Now I’m in a different place… and they won’t let me resign again.</p>

<div class="highlight">
They can block the paperwork. But they can’t block the truth.  
I already left. Spiritually. Mentally. Energetically.  
I’m gone.
</div>

<h2>What kind of clown logic is this?</h2>
<p>They create the problem. Then force you to stay and watch it burn.  
You ask to leave, they say <em>“no.”</em>  
You ask for clarity, they give you chairs dragging at 3AM.</p>

<p>I’ve said it once and I’ll say it louder for the ones in the back:</p>

<blockquote>“I don’t care who the hell you are.  
If you act like a bastar*, I will treat you like one.  
I don’t give a damn.”</blockquote>

<h2>And now?</h2>
<p>Now I want to punch them in the face.  
Not with hands—but with <strong>this blog</strong>. With clarity. With sarcasm.  
Because I don’t need fists to leave bruises where truth hits harder.</p>

<h2>To the entire clown network:</h2>
<p>You tried for years. You failed.  
You couldn’t buy me. You couldn’t shape me.  
And now you can’t even stop me from writing this.</p>

<div class="highlight">
So here’s your punch.  
It’s made of words.  
And it hits where it hurts most:  
your illusion of control.
</div>



<h2>Leadership in Clownland: A Director's Echo</h2>
<p>In 2021, I met a “director.” And I say that with quotation marks, because his decisions were less about leadership and more about emotional weather patterns. Promised reimbursements? Vanished. Clear instructions? Rewritten mid-sentence.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2025, and what do I see again? A new director. Different face, same syndrome: <strong>inconsistent words, unreliable action, and zero shame</strong>.</p>

<p>This isn’t just about utilities or rent. It’s about the very architecture of dysfunction—where people with titles operate like clowns in leadership robes. They speak with confidence and deliver with confusion. Their word isn’t bond. It’s noise.</p>

<div class="highlight">
A director who can't commit to his own sentence structure should never be allowed to direct anyone's future.
</div>

<h2>Receipts They’d Prefer You Ignore</h2>
<p>Let the math speak. Below are the full electricity bills I paid—<strong>just for 2 months</strong>—in a place where the system was designed to confuse, inflate, and deceive. You be the judge.</p>

</ul>

<div class="highlight">
Two months. Two bills. Over €850.  
Not for a factory. Not for Bitcoin mining. Just a shared apartment and a rice cooker.  
Tell me again how this isn’t a circus.
