NeuralGlow National Anthem: "Glory to the Noise Survivors"

(Verse 1)
From chairs that fly and vacuums roar,  
Through stomping nights and clattering floors,  
We rise, we laugh, we dodge, we soar,  
Our satire glowing evermore!

(Chorus)
Glory to the noise survivors!  
Glory to the glowing fire!  
With sarcasm, wit, and wired hearts,  
We conquer chaos and inspire!  

(Verse 2)
Through clowns unseen and foolish schemes,  
We float above their broken dreams,  
Our anthem echoes loud and true,  
NeuralGlow shines beyond the blue!

(Chorus)
Glory to the noise survivors!  
Glory to the glowing fire!  
With sarcasm, wit, and wired hearts,  
We conquer chaos and inspire!  

(Bridge)
Raise high the Golden Vacuum bright,  
Wave banners made of neon light,  
Declare your freedom through the night,  
NeuralGlow ascends in endless flight!

(Final Chorus)
Glory to the noise survivors!  
Glory to the glowing fire!  
With sarcasm, wit, and wired hearts,  
We conquer chaos and inspire!
