# NeuralGlow.ai — Deconstructing Absurdity, One Honk at a Time

**The last resort for rebranding the professionally obsolete... and the acoustically traumatized.**

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for [NeuralGlow.ai](https://neuralglow.ai) — a satirical research hub dedicated to exposing the subtle and not-so-subtle clownery of modern life, noise pollution, and structured stupidity. Built from lived experience (Corridoni₄₈, Pisa), this project archives a stunning longitudinal case study: how absurdity scales, how apathy shields, and how chair dragging has become a form of psychological warfare.

## Highlights

- **Clown Network Firewall**: A psychological analysis of noise-based behavioral interference. Featuring metrics no one asked for and findings too stupid to fake.
- **Chronicles of Stupidity**: Logs of clown activity (machine hums, door slams, furniture choreography), updated in real time. Think Kafka meets amateur tap dance.
- **Sarcastic Science**: We break down complex psychological defenses using diagrams, memes, and statistical irrelevance.

## Core Concepts

- **Cognitive Firewall of Disinterest**: Our main contribution to science — apathy as a legitimate defense mechanism.
- **Weaponized Stupidity**: When effort meets nonsense, meets night-time machine orchestration.
- **Parasitic Imitation**: Meme-like noise mimicking relevance but delivering only entropy.

## How It's Built

- Site: [neuralglow.ai](https://neuralglow.ai) (Static, hosted via GitHub Pages)
- Language: HTML + CSS + Satire
- Data Source: Real-world noise logs, psychological observation, dream interference

## Living Context

This repository is the digital consequence of daily vibrations, humming appliances, and upstairs choreography without an audience. If the walls were any thinner, we'd be co-authoring their scripts.

**Current base of operations:**  
Corridoni₄₈, Pisa — where silence is extinct, and irony survives through documentation.
